# smart-rockets-js

An ongoing implementation of a genetic evolution to simple 2D rockets with map building.

### Getting Started
Use the mouse to build polygons that will act as barriers for the rockets and wait to see the rockets adapt and find a way to the target - rockets need more generations to solve harder maps!
