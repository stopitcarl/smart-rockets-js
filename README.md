# smart-rockets-js

An ongoing implementation of a genetic evolution to simple 2D rockets with map building.

### Getting Started
 https://stopitcarl.github.io/smart-rockets-js/
 
    or
 
 Clone or download the repository and open the index.html file with your favourite browser. 

### How it works
1- Use the mouse to build polygons that will act as barriers between the rockets and their target.

2 - Wait and see the rockets adapt and find a way to the target - rockets need more generations to solve harder maps!

3 - Remember to make maps progressively harder, each new generation is only slightly different than the one before.
  

### Future changes
 * Customizable lifetime, population size and fitness priorities.
 * Draggable target.
 * Engine optimization.
 * Improved UI.
 * Load and export maps and populations to JSON files.
