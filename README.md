# smart-rockets-js

An ongoing implementation of a genetic evolution to simple 2D rockets with map building.

### Getting Started
  https://stopitcarl.github.io/smart-rockets-js/
 or
To run the simulation clone or download the repository and open the index.html file with your browser.
Use the mouse to build polygons that will act as barriers for the rockets and wait to see the rockets adapt and find a way to the target - rockets need more generations to solve harder maps!


### Future features
 * Customizable lifetime, population size and fitness priorities.
 * Draggable target.
 * Engine optimization.
 * Improved UI.
 * Load and export maps and populations to JSON files.
